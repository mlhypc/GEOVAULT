# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-29)

- Writer flushes its buffer to a part file on its own once it holds more than `--flush-mb`
  (default 256 MB) of tiles, so an interrupted static ingest keeps what it fetched instead
  of losing everything held in RAM. A better tile for an already flushed key is appended
  again and wins at compaction (newest `fetched_at`, now strictly increasing per process).
- Static ingests log progress: one line per asset with elapsed, rate and ETA, and one every
  5,000 tiles inside an asset.
- Writer gained `flush()`, `written` (all part files of the session) and a `log` callback;
  `close()` still flushes and auto-compacts.
- `tests/test_store.py` covers auto-flush, flushed-key replacement and month splitting.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: STAC/COG sources, month-partitioned Parquet store, catalog, reader.
